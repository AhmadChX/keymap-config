# Silakka54 – VIAL Keymap Config

Custom keymap configuration for the **Silakka54** split keyboard using VIAL.  
Tailored for daily work, coding, and general productivity.

---

## Notes

- Optimized for split ergonomic use with minimal hand movement.
- Layer toggles are positioned for fast, intuitive switching.
- Built to be flexible — layout will evolve as needs change.
- I’ll keep refining this as I run into limits or new ideas.

Two versions are available: `main` and `alt`.  
I'm currently using `main` as the default.

## How to Use

1. Open the **VIAL** application.
2. Go to `File > Load saved layout...`
3. Select the **silakka54.vil** file from this repo.
